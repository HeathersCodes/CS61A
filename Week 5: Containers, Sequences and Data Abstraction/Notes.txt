2 parts of any program that uses data:

How data are manipulated as units

fraction and rational number
Constructor
selector

#Constructor and selector func work together to specify the right behavior
#behavior: numer(x) / demon(x) == n /d
Constructor and selector definee behavior
recognize da by its behavior not neccesarily how to construct
