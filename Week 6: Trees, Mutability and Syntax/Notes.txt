A tree has a label and a list of branches that is a tree too.
A tree only with label is a leaf

Each location in a tree is called a node (constructed a tree recursively
Each node has a label that can be any value
One node can be parent

the label of tree is selector
make sure while tree constructor, i do not built sth thst is not a tree
to make sure if I pass in other kind of sequance, it get convert to list
