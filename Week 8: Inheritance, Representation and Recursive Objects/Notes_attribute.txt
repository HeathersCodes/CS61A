Func: obj
Bound methouds: obj, a func that has its 1st parameter selfalready bound to an instance
Dot expr eval to bound methods for class attributes that are func
from left to right
>>> type(Account.deposit)
<class 'function'>
>>> type(spock_account.deposit)
<class 'method'>

However, a single assignment statement to a class attribute changes 
the value of the attribute for all instances of the class.
>>> Account.interest = 0.04 #Account is class name
>>> spock_account.interest
0.04
>>> kirk_account.interest
0.04

>>> kirk_account.interest = 0.08
and that attribute value will be returned from a dot expression.
>>> kirk_account.interest
0.08
However, the class attribute interest still retains its original value, which is returned for all other accounts.
>>> spock_account.interest
0.04

>>> Account.interest = 0.05  # changing the class attribute
>>> spock_account.interest     # changes instances without like-named instance attributes
0.05
>>> kirk_account.interest     # but the existing instance attribute is unaffected
0.08
