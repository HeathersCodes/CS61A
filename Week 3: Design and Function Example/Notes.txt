Designing Function
Characteristics Function
Domain: set of all inputs
i.e. x
Range: set of output values it might possibly return
i.e. return a non-negative real number 
Pure func's behavior: relationship it creates between input and output
i.e. return value is the nth fib number

Give one function one job
DRY
define func generally

Function Abstraction
given a name to some process, no worry about detail

Name
Name should convey meaning or purpose
the type is best document in a func's docstring
func name typically tell the affect

Which values deserve a name:
Repeated compound expression
Meaningful parts of complex expr

Name can be long as help docu your code
xyz real number

lf missing ), next line would be wrong (nearby error
traceback tell you happening in your program when the error
TypeError: have some logic flow
