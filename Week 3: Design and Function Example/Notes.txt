Designing Function
Characteristics Function
Domain: set of all inputs
i.e. x
Range: set of output values it might possibly return
i.e. return a non-negative real number 
Pure func's behavior: relationship it creates between input and output
i.e. return value is the nth fib number

Give one function one job
DRY
define func generally
