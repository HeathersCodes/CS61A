s = [3,4,5] #container provide iterator that offers access to its ele in order.
t = iter(s)
next(t) #return 3

After py 3.6, dic i
if dic change the size, I cannot use any of the iterators I've constructed
>>> d = {'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3} # Keys and values
>>> k = iter(d) # next(k)
>>> v = iter(d.values()) # next(v)
>>> k = iter(d)
>>> d.pop('two')

    >>> r = range(3, 6)
    >>> s = iter(r)
    >>> next(s)
    3
    >>> for x in s:
    ...     print(x)
    4
    5
